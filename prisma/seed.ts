      excerpt: "Primary energy imports rose to 62.5% and generation costs surged 83% in four years, an IEEFA report finds, while renewables account for only 2.3% of grid output.",
      content: `<p>Bangladesh's reliance on primary energy imports rose from 47.7 percent to 62.5 percent in four years, leaving the country exposed to volatile global fossil fuel markets. As a result, power generation costs have gone up by 83%, according to a new report.</p>
<p>The report, <strong>"Fostering Bangladesh's Energy Transition,"</strong> published by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), analysed data from FY2020-21 to FY2024-25.</p>
<p>A 290 percent surge in average coal prices between FY21 and FY23, compounded by elevated oil prices and sharp taka depreciation, drove generation costs sharply higher, the report finds.</p>
<p>Despite a 59.7 percent fall in coal prices since FY23 and subdued oil prices, costs did not ease in FY25. Capacity payments were a key factor.</p>
<p>"The average capacity payments of approximately Tk 9.5/kWh ($0.077/kWh) and Tk 5.9/kWh ($0.048/kWh) paid to private oil- and coal-fired plants, respectively, in FY25 raised overall generation costs," said IEEFA lead energy analyst and report author Shafiqul Alam.</p>
<p>Gas supply shortages added further pressure, with plants operating below 25 percent load factor generating power at Tk 16.85/kWh ($0.137/kWh), against Tk 6/kWh ($0.049/kWh) for those running at around 75 percent load.</p>
<p>Declining domestic gas output means Bangladesh must rely increasingly on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG). The report estimates the country could pay $1.07 billion (Tk 131.34 billion) in LNG import subsidies between April and June 2026.</p>
<p>Renewable energy accounts for just 2.3 percent of grid-based generation against a global average of around 33.8 percent. The report estimates 100 megawatts of combined rooftop solar capacity would save more than 30 times its one-off import duties over its lifecycle.</p>
<p>The report also urges Bangladesh to tap hydropower under the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal (BBIN) framework. A combined 6,000MW from Nepal and Bhutan during the peak March-September period could cut annual gas consumption by up to 257 billion cubic feet post-2030.</p>
<p>Bangladesh Power Development Board recorded revenue shortfalls of Tk 556.6 billion ($4.53 billion) in FY25. "The pathway to energy transition hinges on prudent policy decisions supported by a favourable ecosystem," Alam said.</p>`,

      content: `<p>The government yesterday approved the purchase of five liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes, including three from the spot market, to help meet the country's energy demand as supplies under long-term contracts face uncertainty amid the conflict in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase (CCGP) approved the proposals at a meeting yesterday following recommendations from the Energy and Mineral Resources Division.</p>
<p>Among the approved proposals was the purchase of two LNG cargoes from SOCAR Trading SA of Switzerland under a direct procurement method for 2026. Under the agreement, the LNG will be purchased at a price linked to the Japan-Korea Marker (JKM) benchmark, with a premium of $0.25 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).</p>
<p>The committee also approved the purchase of three LNG cargoes from the spot market. The cargoes are scheduled for delivery during three separate windows: June 26-27, June 30-July 1 and July 6-7.</p>
<p>According to the approvals, BP Singapore Pte Ltd will supply one cargo, while TotalEnergies Gas & Power Ltd of the UK will supply the remaining two.</p>
<p>The additional cargoes are expected to support power plants and industrial consumers facing gas rationing during peak summer demand, when domestic production and pipeline supplies typically fall short of requirements.</p>`,

      content: `<p>The Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) has once again significantly increased electricity prices in the country. Under the new announcement, electricity prices have been raised by an average of 16.68 percent across consumer categories.</p>
<p>Industrial consumers, particularly those in the readymade garment and textile sectors, face steep increases that will feed directly into production costs. Household consumers in higher slab categories will also see noticeably larger monthly bills.</p>
<p>BERC officials cited rising fuel costs, capacity payments to independent power producers, and the taka's depreciation against the US dollar as primary drivers behind the adjustment.</p>
<p>Trade bodies have warned that repeated tariff hikes without corresponding improvements in supply reliability could erode Bangladesh's export competitiveness, especially as regional rivals maintain more stable power pricing.</p>
<p>Consumer rights groups staged demonstrations outside the BERC headquarters during the public hearing process, arguing that subsidy rationalisation should target inefficiency and system losses before passing costs to end users.</p>
<p>The new rates take effect immediately for bulk supply and will cascade to retail tariffs through distribution companies over the coming billing cycle.</p>`,

<p>At the wholesale level, the Bangladesh Power Development Board and affiliated entities will pay higher bulk supply tariffs designed to narrow the gap between average cost of service and regulated revenue recovery.</p>
<p>Distribution utilities including DESCO, DPDC, and the Palli Bidyut Samity network received revised rate schedules differentiated by voltage level and consumer class.</p>
<p>Officials emphasised that lifeline consumers in the lowest consumption bracket would see more modest adjustments compared with large industrial and commercial accounts.</p>
<p>The commission also signalled that further automatic adjustments linked to fuel price pass-through mechanisms could follow if international energy markets remain volatile through the second half of 2026.</p>`,

With numerous factories that have completed construction unable to commence operations, investors are facing mounting carrying costs.</p>
<p>Petrobangla and the Energy and Mineral Resources Division have struggled to allocate new connections as domestic production declines and LNG import capacity remains constrained during peak demand periods.</p>
<p>Business leaders estimate that delayed commissioning across multiple zones could affect tens of thousands of projected jobs if gas allocations are not resolved before the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>Officials have pointed to new LNG cargoes and expanded regasification throughput at Moheshkhali as near-term remedies, but investors argue that firm delivery timelines are needed before additional capital commitments materialise.</p>
<p>The Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority has requested a fast-track review of pending connection applications for export-oriented units with signed international purchase agreements.</p>`,

<p>The initiative covers multiple offshore blocks and introduces improved cost-recovery provisions and arbitration clauses designed to address concerns raised by international majors in previous bidding rounds.</p>
<p>Energy officials expect strong interest from regional and global players given rising domestic gas demand and the success of neighbouring offshore programmes.</p>
<p>Domestic exploration has yielded limited new discoveries in recent years, increasing reliance on imported LNG. Successful offshore development could materially improve Bangladesh's long-term energy security outlook.</p>
